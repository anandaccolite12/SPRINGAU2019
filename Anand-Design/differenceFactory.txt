								Difference between Factory and Abstract factory design pattern
Factory design:
	1. In this design, we define an interface which will expose a method which will create objects for us.
	2. Return type of that method is never be a concrete type rather it will be some interface or abstract class
	3. It produce instances of implementations of a particular interface 
Abstract Factory design:
	 1. In this design, we define an interface which will create families of related or dependent objects.
	 2. The ConcreteFactory object can be implemented as a Singleton as only one instance of the ConcreteFactory object is needed.
